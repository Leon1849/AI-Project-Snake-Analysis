# AI Snake Game

## Project Overview
The AI Snake Game is an advanced version of the classic Snake game, enhanced with artificial intelligence. It incorporates multiple AI search algorithms to govern its movement, providing a challenging and dynamic gaming experience. The project was conducted by modifying a prewritten Python code and enhancing its results, followed by studies and documentation of the entire process.
